# NextJS-Weather-Client
I created this front-end to display data received from my Express-API-Server. This client pulls current, hourly, and weekly forecast data from three open weather APIs.

A user is able to input a city to ping the server and see those different weather API data points in a consistent format. For more information, a user is able to view a detailed table by hour regarding tempeature, humidity, AQI, and more.

Once a city is entered, the user is able to click "What should I wear? to receive a brief overview of clothing suggestions given the current real feel temperature and the weather conditions.
